This CIP formalises the behaviour of state changes within a Cypher query.

=== Background

Cypher allows clauses that read from the graph to be interleaved with clauses that write to the graph.
Some clauses can also do both - read the graph and write to it at the same time.

To allow the user to understand what the outcome will be at an abstract, logical level, semantics for the visibility of these changes should be clear.

Note:
This is not about concurrency - even in a single user system this would need to be thought through and defined explicitly.

===== Definition

We call the concept discussed in this CIP _eagerness_.
This means that each clause logically consumes  _all_ incoming rows _eagerly_, and only produces output when the input is exhausted.
This concept is in contrast to link:https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lazy_evaluation[_lazy evaluation_], which, when applied to Cypher, means that each clause only processes as much input as is necessary for the first record of output to be sent to the subsequent clause.

=== Proposal

Each clause lives in its own state, which includes all the changes of clauses coming before it, including changes performed by itself,
*but none of the changes made by clauses listed later in the query.*

The semantical data flow here is such that each clause operates on the entire result set before passing control to any subsequent clause.

Updates between `UNION` subqueries are also treated in a sequential manner.
Therefore subqueries coming later will see updates from subqueries before, but not the other way around.

==== Examples

.Example query 1:
The following query would lead to a never-ending loop, if a lazy `MATCH` clause is not isolated from the new nodes created by `CREATE`.

_Query_
[source,cypher]
----
MATCH (a)
CREATE ()
----

.Example query 2:

Given a database containing two nodes, we illustrate the subtleties of query execution with the following query.

[source,cypher]
----
MATCH ()
CREATE ()
WITH *
MATCH ()
CREATE ()
----

|===
| Query       | Pre-existing nodes  | Rows in  | Nodes created  | Rows out
| `MATCH ()`  | 2                   | 1        | 0              | 2 (N)
| `CREATE ()` | 2                   | 2        | 2 \(R)         | 2
| `WITH *`    | 4                   | 2        | 0              | 2
| `MATCH ()`  | 4                   | 2        | 0              | 8 (N * R)
| `CREATE ()` | 4                   | 8        | 8              | 8
| _Outcome_   | *12 (2 + 2 + 8)*    | -        | *10*           | *8*
|===

.Example query 3:
In the following query, the `MATCH` following the `UNION` will find the nodes created before the `UNION`.

[source,cypher]
----
CREATE (a:X)
RETURN a AS column
UNION
MATCH (x:X)
CREATE ()
RETURN x as column
----

=== Benefits to this proposal

Explicit state change visibility makes it possible to understand queries without having to worry about ordering of updates and reads.

From an implementation perspective, these semantics also allow us to make some queries more performant than they can be today, by ignoring statement state for a lot of graph reading, and saving us from eagerly producing matching results before updates can be applied.

This replaces the past definition in CIP20140109.

=== Caveats to this proposal

None known at the moment.
