== Background

The expression sub-languages of openCypher (and most other query and programming languages) allow very liberal composition of different elementary expressions into complex expressions through nesting.
Elementary expression the kinds of expressions the expression sub-languages provides and which for the building blocks of the sub-languages.
Some elementary expressions have zero operands, e.g. literals.
Most elementary expressions have one or more operands.
For instance,

- A arithmetic negation has one operand,
- A boolean conjunction has two operands,
- A property access has two operands -- an element and a property key,
- A function call has two operands -- a function name and an arguments list,
- A list comprehension has three or four operands -- an element variable name, a list, a predicate, and optionally a projection expression
- A case expression has multiple operands -- a value to test, for every case a test value/predicate and a result value, and a default value of the 'else' case

Some operands expect non-values, typically identifiers (variable names, function names, property keys, etc.).
Such _non-value operands_ do not allow nesting of expressions because expression only resulting in values.
However, most operands expect values of some types.
Such _value operands_ allow nesting of all expressions that result in a values of the expected type.
The nested expressions form a tree and are typically evaluated bottom-up, i.e. all expressions are evaluated that provide an operand before the expression is evaluated that takes these operands.
(Higher-order expression, e.g. list comprehensions, have operands which are exceptions to this bottom-up evaluation.)
In other words, the nesting tree encodes the evaluation order.
For instance, the following tree
----
    *
   / \
  +   4
 / \
3   2
----
encodes that the numeric addition is evaluated before the numeric multiplication, so that the expression results in 20.

However, the query string is a sequence of characters and not a tree.
The parser turns the query string into such a tree.
The query string nesting can clearly be denoted by parentheses.
For instance, the query string
----
((3+2)*4)
----
allows a parser to unambiguously construct the nesting tree shown above.

For user convenience, better readability, and familiarity with common convention in mathematical notation, openCypher (and most other query and programming languages) allows omitting the parentheses.
For instance,
----
3+2*4
----
is also a valid expression.

Without additional rules, it is not possible to unambiguously construct a nesting tree for such expression, though.
In the particular case, two nesting trees are possible:

- `((3+2)*4)`
- `(3+(2*4))`

To avoid this kind of ambiguity, openCypher (and most other query and programming languages) has _precedence rules_.

Precedence rules (or rules of operator precedence) define the order in which the different operators, i.e. the different operators kinds of expressions, are evaluated.
For instance, numeric multiplication is evaluated before numeric addition, such that expression
----
3+2*4
----
is effectively evaluated as
----
(3+(2*4))
----
and, hence, results in 11 (rather than 20).

This CIP states the precedence rules of openCypher.
