This repository holds the specification of Cypher, a declarative property graph query language.
Its purpose is to be central to the process of evolving the specification and standardisation of Cypher as a graph query language.

== Overview of the process

Changes to openCypher are made through consensus in the openCypher Implementers Group (oCIG).
The process for proposing changes, voting on proposals and measuring consensus is described in https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1OHMxiz9xW6rINiJcCdm28a8uNcZEtCsMPfhFSIA-XXE/edit[this set of slides].

Refer to the link:CIP-PROCESS.adoc[Cypher Improvement Process] document for more details on CIPs, CIRs, their structure and lifecycle.

== The structure of this repository

* Cypher Improvement Proposals (CIP), `/cip`
** Contains a list of accepted CIP documents.
* Cypher grammar, `/grammar`

*** Railroad diagrams
*** EBNF
*** ANTLR4 Grammar
* Cypher Technology Compatibility Kit (TCK), `/tck`
** Contains a set of Cucumber features that define Cypher behaviour, and documentation on how to use it.
* openCypher developer tools, `/tools`
** Contains code that tests the integrity of the repository, generates release artifacts, and aids implementers of openCypher.
