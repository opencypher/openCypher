/** Publishes TCK scenario execution events.
  *
  * The available event sources are:
  *
  * <li>[[TCKEvents.feature]] - sent for each feature file read, contains the feature file source.
  * <li>[[TCKEvents.scenario]]  - sent before starting the execution of a Scenario.
  * <li>[[TCKEvents.stepStarted]] - sent before starting the execution of a Test Step, contains the Test Step.
  * <li>[[TCKEvents.stepFinished]] - sent after the execution of a Test Step, contains the Test Step and its Result.
  * <p>
  * Usage example, subscribing to [[TCKEvents.scenario]] events:
  * <pre>{@code
  * TCKEvents.scenario.subscribe(scenario => { println scenario.name })
