  Scenario Outline: [1] Outline Test
    Given an empty graph
    When executing query:
      """
      RETURN <sample>
      """
    Then the result should be, in any order:
      | <column> |
      | <result> |
    And no side effects

    Examples:
      | sample | column | result |
      | 1      | 1      | 1      |
      | 2      | 2      | 2      |

      """
    Then the result should be, in any order:
