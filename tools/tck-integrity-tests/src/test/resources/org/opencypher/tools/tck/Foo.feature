  Scenario: Conflicting parameters in CSV and parameter
    Given an empty graph
    And there exists a CSV file with URL as $param, with rows:
      | i | txt |
      | 1 | 'a' |
      | 2 | 'b' |
    And parameters are:
      | param | [] |

    When executing query:
      """
      RETURN 1
      """
    Then the result should be, in any order:
      | 1 |
      | 1 |
    And no side effects
